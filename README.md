# Official TrackDayR Documentation Repository

To all who come to this happy place: welcome.

This is the repo for docs.trackdayr.com. This repo contains all the source code we use to build our docs site.

## We are TrackDayR
TrackDayR is an all-in-one bike simulator focused on providing a realistic and immersive experience. We want you to
enjoy every aspect of the game, so we created this documentation website where you can find all the information and
guide you need. We are also very open to modding, so here you will find all kind of detail to create content for
our simulator.

## You are Awesome
You can also help make the docs awesome. Your feedback is welcome. Your writing, editing, designing, and developing
skills are welcome. You being a part of our community is welcome. To start contributing, check out our
